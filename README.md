This is a homemade version of Wordle. It is meant to be engaged via the terminal. Input syntax is: python for_examination [the name of a document (.txt) containing several 5-letter words, each on its own line] [number of guesses you want to have (classic Wordle has 6]

An example of the text document might be: words.txt

below
crazy
sugar
pizza
fails
pills

The program chooses one word at random and allows the user to guess.

Full disclosure, this is probably pretty bad code, but hey, for an early project, I'm proud of it.
